    <title>Square bracket computed properties</title>
</head>
<body>
    <p>
        We can use square brackets in an object literal, <br>
        when creating an object.That's called computed properties. <br>
    </p>
 

    <pre>
        code 1:
            let fruit =prompt("Which fruit to buy ?","apple");
    
            let bag={
                [fruit]:5//the name of the property is taken from the variable fruit
            };
            alert(bag.apple);
            
        
    
        Code 2:
            //same code concept of above
            let fruits =prompt("which fruits to buy ?","apple");//we can change fruits instead of fruit because multi redeclaration is not allow in let
             
            let bags={};
            //take property name from the fruit variable
            bags[fruits]=5;
            alert(bags.apple);//5
            alert(bags.b);//undefined
    

        code 3:
          //concatenated the variable and string in square bracket in object of key
            let toy="car";
    
            let box={
                [toy+'key']:2//box.carkey=2
            };
            alert(box.carkey);//2
        
        
    </pre>


    <script>
        let fruit =prompt("Which fruit to buy ?","apple");

        let bag={
            [fruit]:5//the name of the property is taken from the variable fruit
        };
        alert(bag.apple);
        
    </script>

    <script>
        //same code of above
        let fruits =prompt("which fruits to buy ?","apple");//we can change fruits instead of fruit because multi redeclaration is not allow in let
         
        let bags={};
        //take property name from the fruit variable
        bags[fruits]=5;
        alert(bags.apple);//5
        alert(bags.b);//undefined

    </script>




    <script>
        let toy="car";

        let box={
            [toy+'key']:2//box.carkey=2
        };
        alert(box.carkey);//2
    </script>
